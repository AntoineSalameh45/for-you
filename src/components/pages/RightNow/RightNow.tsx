      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Hey...</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">
        So I know we haven't been on the best terms lately.
        <br />
        It's been a tough shitass week I know. Lots of things happened,
        and a lot more to come. But our story wasn't always like that...
      </p>
      <h2>Ouverture des rideaux</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">
        It all started on the genshin group, before that all I new is this girl likes to call me sophia oddly enough.
        I was still new and asking lots of questions and you were there to answer them. I went into your dms 
        to ask you about characters and team comps lol. Idk how but we started co-oping, 
        more precisely I started joining you and the gnome in co-op. It went on for a few days
        then we turned ou to be neighbors, and I was like "ah kool". Next thing I know you went like
        let's meetup tomorrow and Mr.Brown. I lowkey panicked cause wdym a girl asked me to hangout???
        </p>
        <h3>Fast forward the next day</h3>
        <p>
          How will I know her? How does she look like? Where is she? Then you appeared and i was like
          "Kawaii". I was nervously yapping in a way cause idk u were cute i was weird and didn't know
          what to do. Our first meeting was brief but kool i immediatly wanted to see you again.
          Back then i was totally clueless about your condition. Then one day not long after we went for a walk.
          It was nice and I enjoyed it. You punched me for paying and not wanting to take your money. I knew
          you were different.
          We yapped and yapped then it was go-time. 
        </p>
        <h3>Uni and atcl hangouts</h3>
        <p>
          You still had uni and I was enrolled in the bootcamp so we didn't hangout much but we were still
          chatting and playing genshin. Signs appeared along the way of how i was getting hooked, attached,
          I was a little too clingy. It showed something was up. Back then it was maybe just cz u were nice
          to me for no reason, maybe also cause i needed someone to yap too without being judged. You know
          the story about my bestie and i was still not over the feeling of being lonely. We went to hangout
          at ATCL you had your laptop and me my phone so we play genshin. We did for a bit then i was just 
          contemplating your play. It went for like an hour then idk how but you confronted me and I went blank.
          I felt so small cause i was literally getting rejected before even trying. But you made it clear and import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
          was for the best to the both of us. I tried.. I really did but.. I couldn't help it.
        </p>
        <h3>We still hung out and stayed fremds</h3>
        <p>
          We kept chatting and yapping and playing and going out. I met your dad then other members of the family.
          I felt accepted in a way even tho we're just friends. You know i was giggling about the bf allegations
          while you were like "nu uh we're just friends". I was like "kool, i can live with that".
          But for how long actually? Every time i was looking at you like "damn she's cute". I didn't even 
          need to speak it was all obvious. I was getting attached and i knew it.
