              It all started on the genshin group, before that all I new is this
              girl likes to call me sophia oddly enough. I was still new and
              asking lots of questions and you were there to answer them. I went
              into your dms to ask you about characters and team comps lol. Idk
              how but we started co-oping, more precisely I started joining you
              and the gnome in co-op. It went on for a few days then we turned
              out to be neighbors, and I was like "ah kool". Next thing I know
              you went like let's meetup tomorrow and Mr.Brown. I lowkey

              How will I know her? How does she look like? Where is she? Then
              you appeared and i was like "Kawaii". I was nervously yapping in a
              way cause idk u were cute i was weird and didn't know what to do.
              Our first meeting was brief but kool i immediatly wanted to see
              you again. Back then i was totally clueless about your condition.
              Then one day not long after we went for a walk. It was nice and I
              enjoyed it. You punched me for paying and not wanting to take your
              money. I knew you were different. We yapped and yapped then it was
              go-time.

              You still had uni and I was enrolled in the bootcamp so we didn't
              hangout much but we were still chatting and playing genshin. Signs
              appeared along the way of how i was getting hooked, attached, I
              was a little too clingy. It showed something was up. Back then it
              was maybe just cz u were nice to me for no reason, maybe also
              cause i needed someone to yap too without being judged. You know
              the story about my bestie and i was still not over the feeling of
              being lonely. We went to hangout at ATCL you had your laptop and
              me my phone so we play genshin. We did for a bit then i was just
              contemplating your play. It went for like an hour then idk how but
              you confronted me and I went blank. I felt so small cause i was
              literally getting rejected before even trying. But you made it
              clear and was for the best to the both of us. I tried.. I really
              did but.. I couldn't help it.

              We kept chatting and yapping and playing and going out. I met your
              dad then other members of the family. I felt accepted in a way
              even tho we're just friends. You know i was giggling about the bf
              allegations while you were like "nu uh we're just friends". I was
              like "kool, i can live with that". But for how long actually?
              Every time i was looking at you like "damn she's cute". I didn't
              even need to speak it was all obvious. I was getting attached and
              i knew it.

              It was the first time we go out for a whole day after i got to
              know you a bit more and understand your condition just a little
              bit. On that day we were having fun until it became too mcuh for
              you. It was the first time i see you like that, I just didn't know
              what to do and how to help. i made lots of mistakes and still do
              everyday trying to understand what i should do. If i learned
              anything is that most of the time I should actually just give you
              space and let you be. Something I'm still tryna change about
              myself. It's never actually about me, it never was. I thought I
              was showing that I care by being there for you but it was actually
              the opposite. I was just being selfish and i didn't realize it
              until now. I've been a bit pushy, a crybaby, and a little too
              clingy. I always try to find solutions when sometimes there is
              nothing to do but to be there and listen or just give you your
              space and wait for you to come back once you feel a bit better. I
              said you're like a cat but I always forget that this is kind of
              how cats are. On the other side I'm like a dog, I always want to
              be around you, I always want to play and yap. I just can't help
              it, I like you a lot. I know it's not easy for you to deal with me
              and my clinginess but I hope you can forgive me for that.

              Where we are now
            </h3>
            <p className="mb-10 text-paragraph p-2">
              The day we went fishing was just like any other day. We spent time
              together not knowing what was gonna happen. I was just happy being
              with you and enjoying our time. I got a bit tired and sleepy so i
              layed down then after some time you had enough of it and stopped
              fishing. We talked like a lot, I won't go back into details cz
              that's the last thing you wanna hear about. But let me add this,
              when we were just sitting and scrolling through tiktoks and
              laughing, I was genuinely so happy I didn't care about anything
              else in the entire world. Then it happened. I took time to process
              it. I was smiling like an idiot for a whole day I couldn't even
              sleep. Not thinking about how you went through it and processed
              it, at this moment i was happy and selfish about it. You needed
              time to gather your thoughts, time that was cut short. The thing
              we feared the most happened. I know I shouldn't say "we" when
              actually it was never about me, it was about you. It was your life
              that was going crushing down. Yeah I lost it, we did, both me and
              your kiddo. Why did we when it was never about us? Cause it was
              you. Again maybe in my case it was for selfish reasons and when it
              didn't go the way I wanted I started blaming myself and
              victimizing myself at once. I wasn't thinking straight. Ok i'm sad
              but what about her? It's literally her life. she's the actual
              victim in all this. I know a lot of what i said even here when i'm
              tryna apologize is gonna pyo. I know I said this before but never
              really shown any progress but I'm trying to be better, I have to
              be mature, I gotta start to be the man i have to be. I'm sorry for
              thinking about me when it was about you. I'll give you your space
              for now, at least that's what I'm trying to do. I will always be
              here to listen to you. I don't wanna lose the friend I found in
              you. I know i was dismissive in a lot of things just cause I was
              blinded by my own delusions. I am not even going through the
              points i wanna make one by one it's just a big ball of mess. It
              might seem crazy what I'm trying to say, but basically it's a big
              apology for being the way that i am, I'm gonna try to just put
              that in my head and give u space and time when needed. I'll also
              stop, at least try, to be that immature/stupid person. I am not
              going to pressure you and be more understanding.
